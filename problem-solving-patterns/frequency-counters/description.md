# This pattern uses object or sets to collect values/ frequencies of values

    * this can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings
    * this is useful in situations where you have multiple pieces of data, multiple inputs and you
        you need to compare them(is value contained in another array, is string anagram, etc.)
